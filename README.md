# Mzansi Crime Idle 🇿🇦

**Mzansi Crime Idle** is a satirical incremental clicker game set in the chaotic underworld of South Africa. Rise from a street-level *tsotsi* to a state-capturing kingpin in this idle management game.

## 📖 About the Game

In **Mzansi Crime Idle**, you don't just rob banks; you heist CIT vans, engage in taxi wars, and dabble in tender fraud. The game captures the unique flavor of South African life, slang, and crime. Your goal is to accumulate as much Rands (R) as possible, unlocking powerful weapons and automated income streams along the way.

## ✨ Features

- **🔫 Local Arsenal:** Trade your fists for an *Okapi*, upgrade to a *Sjambok*, and eventually wield the firepower of an *R5 Rifle* or the mythical *Tokoloshe Spirit*.
- **💼 South African Hustles:**
  - Start small with *Smash and Grabs* and *Spaza Shop Robberies*.
  - Move up to *ATM Bombings* and *CIT Heists*.
  - Reach the top with *State Capture* and *Gupta Compound Raids*.
- **📈 Idle Progression:** Your hustles earn money while you sleep. Come back to a pile of Rands.
- **🔄 Prestige System:** Reset your progress to gain "Chips", unlock new characters, and permanently boost your earning potential.
- **🏆 Achievements:** Unlock achievements like "Tenderpreneur", "Taxi Boss", and "Zama Zama".

## 🕹️ How to Play

1.  **Click:** Click the weapon icon to generate active income.
2.  **Buy:** Purchase missions to generate passive income.
3.  **Upgrade:** Buy better weapons to increase your click damage.
4.  **Prestige:** When progress slows down, use the "Character" menu to prestige, resetting your cash/missions but gaining powerful multipliers.
